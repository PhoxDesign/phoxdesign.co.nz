# Site5 - Tied For First

Site5 is a great company that has been around for a while and is heavily involved in the Ruby on Rails community. To see how involved they are with Ruby on Rails just check out the Site5 Ruby on Rails page. They use FastCGI, are Switchtower/Capistrano-ready, EdgeRails ready, offer Subversion on all severs and a lot of their tools use Rails! They are almost done with a ruby on rails utility that keeps backups of all your files for you and you can rever back to multiple different changes at any time. Very cool!

You can read user reviews at Site5Reviews.com. If you do choose them be sure to check out their special page. They often have $10.00 rebates or free months if you check!


# Lunarpages - Good but no shell access!

    Lunarpages is our 2nd pick for ruby on rails hosting, mostly because they lack shell access. They are a great company with awesome support who we have used for a long time. They have great reviews which you can see at LunarpagesReview.com (collects reviews from forums, submissions, etc). Both their basic and business plan support Ruby on Rails fully.

        Features:
        - FastCGI on all servers for Ruby on Rails.
        - Great forum at lunarforums.com for all ruby on rails support etc.
        - Forum guide on deploying RoR on Lunarpages.
        - 24/7 Support via phone, chat, email. 

# BlueHost

    BlueHost is a great pick for ruby on rails hosting due to their support of the framework and great uptime! For user reviews of BlueHost just visit BlueHostReviews.com. They have collected reviews from different forums such as WebHostingTalk and Sitepoint and put them in one location, plus they take submitted reviews. Also here is a nice help desk article on how to setup Ruby on Rails with BlueHost.
    John Shea sent in this great guide to Ruby on Rails on BlueHost! It has some great tips and lots of great info!

        - BlueHost Features With Respect To Ruby on Rails:
        - Shell Access
        - Easy to Create new Apps
        - Lots of Installed Gems for Rails...
        - Tons of Bandwidth/Diskspace and Good Server Uptime


# HostMonster

    HostMonster supports Ruby on Rails version 1.1 and any future versions. For their setup instructions on how to create rails applications just read this help desk tutorial. We put them third as in our testing they have fast servers, decent support, and support everything you need with ruby on rails. We just found out they are owned by BlueHost as well so same people run both companies just different plans with this one. Shell access included.


# DreamHost

    DreamHost is a large hosting company and currently supports Ruby on Rails. The reason they are rated sixth is they oversell their servers so the servers are very slow and sluggish some times or depending on who you are sharing with. This is why we don't recommend them in most situations. They also don't have as good a reputation for user support as either of the other two hosting companies.

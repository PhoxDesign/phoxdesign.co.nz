categories: seo

Google has recently updated their Search Engine Algorithm and named it “Penguin“. Still the topic is hot and Webmasters are busy to cope with it. Google has just made a minor update on their Page Rank for the month of May 2012. WP Cypher got PR1 with this update and I’m really happy with this achievement.

## What is Google PR (Page Rank)?

According to Wikipedia, PageRank is a link analysis algorithm, named after Larry Page and used by the Google Internet search engine, that assigns a numerical weighting to each element of a hyperlinked set of documents, such as the World Wide Web, with the purpose of “measuring” its relative importance within the set.

So, Google PageRank actually depends on how your site is connected or hyperlinked with other sites and also how you hyperlink with others.

## Google PR (Page Rank) Update May 2012

I have just checked the Google PageRank for my blog and found out that this blog has got PageRank 1, previously it was 0. So, I’m little bit happy with the progress as still it’s a new blog. I’ve just started writing regularly and hope it will do good in the future.

The PageRank of this portfolio site remains the same as before. No update!

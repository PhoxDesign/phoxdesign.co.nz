<h3>**Responsive Web design** is the approach that suggests that design and development should **respond** to the user’s behavior and **environment** based on screen size, platform and orientation.</h3>

</h3>**Responsive web design** is a relatively new approach to website design that ensures users have a good viewing experience no matter what type of device they’re using. It’s become increasingly important over the last few years as mobile device ownership has exploded and traditional PC sales have slowed.</h3>

<h3>Now that **Google** is prioritizing mobile-friendly sites in its search results algorithm, it’s essential to make sure your site is optimized for mobile by using responsive design.</h3>

<h3>All our websites are designed and built to be fully responsive.</h3>
